            <p>Number one on this list of the top 10 oil-producing countries is the US. It produced the most oil in
                2019, with output increasing from 17,886,000 bpd in 2018 to 19,510,000 bpd.</p>

            <p>Saudi Arabia’s output came in at 12,419,000 bpd in 2018, and declined to 11,810,000 in 2019. The Middle
                Eastern country possesses 18 percent of the world’s proven petroleum reserves and ranks as the largest
                exporter of petroleum. Its oil and gas sector accounts for about 50 percent of its GDP, and about 85
                percent of its export earnings.

            <p>Russian oil output has been increasing steadily over the years, growing from 11,401,000 bpd in 2018 to
                11,490,000 bpd last year. Despite coming in third on the list, Russia is the world’s largest producer of
                crude oil and the second largest producer of dry natural gas, according to the EIA. Most of Russia’s
                reserves are located in West Siberia, between the Ural Mountains and the Central Siberian Plateau, as
                well as in the Urals-Volga region, extending into the Caspian Sea.</p>

                oil to the largest in 2014.</p>

            <p>In 2017, despite increasing its output, Iraq got bumped from sixth place by Iran on this top 10
                oil-producing countries list. Output in 2018 helped the nation regain its sixth spot position. The
                Middle Eastern country marginally increased its oil production from 4,616,000 bpd in 2018 to 4,740,000
                bpd in 2019. It holds the world’s fifth largest proven oil reserves at 144 billion barrels; that
                represents nearly 18 percent of the reserves in the Middle East and almost 9 percent of global reserves.

                decades. In 2018, it saw a small decrease in production from the previous year’s 3,791,000 bpd; however,
                it appears that oil output has stabilized and is back up to 4,010,000 bpd.</p>

            <p>Last year, Brazil’s oil production jumped dramatically from 3,428,000 bpd in 2018 to 3,678,000 bpd.

                According to the EIA, total primary energy consumption in Brazil has nearly doubled in the past decade
                because of sustained economic growth. The largest share of Brazil’s total energy consumption is oil and
                other liquid fuels, followed by hydroelectricity and natural gas. The recent surge in production and
                exports is said to be the result of years of large investments by state-run Petróleo Brasileiro
                (Petrobras).</p>

            <p>Iran’s oil output decreased last year, falling from 4,471,000 bpd in 2018 to 3,190,000 bpd. According to
                the EIA, Iran holds the world’s fourth largest proven oil reserves and the world’s second largest
                natural gas reserves. Despite the country’s abundant reserves, Iran’s oil production has substantially
                fallen in recent years, and natural gas production growth has been slower than expected.</p>
